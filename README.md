# CHESS ENGINE
The files implement two little snippets that allow you to play chess. Currently, the project is still incomplete, but at current commit stage you are allowed to play following the classical game rules. The only exception is the handling of the moves of a king when in check. Further developments that are planned are:
- Fixing king moves under checks mechanics
- Adding various graphical features
- Expliciting checkmate or stalemate when a game is finished
- Adding an AI Class that will be able to act as a player
- Using Reinforcement Learning to create a good enough AI-based chess engine

The project is written in pure Python using the pygame library and its extension pygame-popup, which will hopefully handle some minor graphical aspects, including a basic menu to pick between color palettes, pick the AI level, and other stuff. 

The project was created as a little funny snippet in order to familiarize a little bit with a codebase a little more complex than a school-level snippet. More details will emerge as the project grow in dimension, stay tuned!
